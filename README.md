A professionally curated list of **Large Foundation Models for Weather and Climate Data Understanding (e.g., time-series, spatio-temporal series, video streams, graphs, and text)** with awesome resources (paper, code, data, etc.), which aims to comprehensively and systematically summarize the recent advances to the best of our knowledge.

We will continue to update this list with the newest resources. If you find any missed resources (paper/code) or errors, please feel free to open an issue or make a pull request.
