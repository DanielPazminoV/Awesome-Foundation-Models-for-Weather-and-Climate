A professionally curated list of **Large Foundation Models for Weather and Climate Data Understanding (e.g., time-series, spatio-temporal series, video streams, graphs, and text)** with awesome resources (paper, code, data, etc.), which aims to comprehensively and systematically summarize the recent advances to the best of our knowledge.

**<font color="red">[Paper]</font>** Our survey: [Foundation Models for Weather and Climate Data Understanding: A Comprehensive Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.03014.pdf) has appeared on arXiv, which is the first work to comprehensively and systematically summarize DL-based weather and climate data understanding, paving the way for the development of weather and climate foundation models. üå§Ô∏è‚õàÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è



We will continue to update this list with the newest resources. If you find any missed resources (paper/code) or errors, please feel free to open an issue or make a pull request.
